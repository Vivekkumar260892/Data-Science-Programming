# In our project, we address the issues regarding classification of spatial data and concentrate on building decision trees for the classification of such data. We used Geometric Information Systems (GIS) to build a solution to label “Rural” and “Urban” counties in 5 different states in the United States. These labels have been created based on the area of the county, the length of the roads and the length of rails passing through the county. We have calculated all of these fields using libraries like Geopandas, Shapely and Fiona 
# Further, we have built a solution to calculate the distance and travel time of a facility location from a given incident point, such as, the nearest hospital location and drive time from an accident spot.
# To do this, we have used geospatial data files from the GIS system (geographical information system) and ArcGIS APIs.
# Geospatial data provides the strong technical support for multi-level geo-spatial data acquisition, such as photogrammetry to remote sensing, traditional paper surveying and mapping to digital surveying and mapping, from mobile surveying and mapping to sensor networks.

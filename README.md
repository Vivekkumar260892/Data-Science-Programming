## Introduction
#### In the project, I address the issues regarding classification of spatial data and concentrate on building decision trees for the classification of such data. I used Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to build a solution to label “Rural” and “Urban” counties in 5 different states in the United States. These labels have been created based on the area of the county, the length of the roads and the length of rails passing through the county. I calculated all of these fields using libraries like Geopandas, Shapely and Fiona. 
#### Further, I have built a solution to calculate the distance and travel time of a facility location from a given incident point, such as, the nearest hospital location and drive time from an accident spot.
#### To do this, I have used geospatial data files from the GIS system (geographical information system) and ArcGIS APIs.
